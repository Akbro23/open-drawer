"""Run a policy in the loop, and score it the same way the teacher is scored.

    uv run evaluate --mode policy --video out/eval.mp4

This is the other half of `record.py`. That module defines what an action MEANS;
this one is the only place that has to interpret it, and it has to interpret it
identically or the numbers a policy emits mean something other than what they
meant in training. Two contracts, both inherited:

  RATE   one action per `record_every` control steps -- 25 Hz. Not "about
         25 Hz": the delta was measured over exactly that window.
  DELTA  command `q_measured + action`, never `action` alone. The recorded
         value is a command offset and it carries the standing error the
         position controller needs just to hold the arm up against gravity.
         Commanding the delta alone drops that, and the arm sags a little
         further every tick.

REPLAY IS THE REGRESSION. Feeding the teacher's own recorded actions back
through this loop has to reproduce the demonstration. If it does not, the
recorded actions do not mean what this loop thinks they mean, and no amount of
training will fix it -- the dataset and the deployment would be different
control problems. It needs no checkpoint and no lerobot, so it is the cheapest
test in the project and the one that catches the most.
