"""pi0.5 with a tactile encoder wired into the action expert's conditioning.

WHY NOT observation.state. pi0.5 does not feed state to the action expert as a
vector. `Pi05PrepareStateTokenizerProcessorStep` normalizes it, digitizes it
into 256 bins and pastes it into the TEXT prompt -- "Task: open the left
drawer, State: 128 91 204 ...". A contact signal folded in there arrives 8-bit
quantized through the tokenizer, and ours is quiet for most of an episode and
then steps, so after per-dim normalization the quiet majority collapses into a
bin or two while the event saturates. Exactly the wrong channel for the one
transient the task turns on.

WHERE IT GOES INSTEAD. `PI05Pytorch.embed_suffix` builds `adarms_cond` from the
flow-matching timestep, and `PaliGemmaWithExpertModel.forward` passes it as
`adarms_cond=[None, cond]` -- index 0 is the VLM, index 1 the action expert --
where that single (B, width) vector modulates EVERY adaRMSNorm in the expert.
Adding a tactile embedding to it puts touch on a continuous path straight into
the action decoder, with no tokenizer in between. It is global FiLM-style
modulation: good at gating "am I loaded or not", carrying no spatial structure
of its own.

ZERO INIT. The second linear starts at zero, so `tactile_mlp(x) == 0` and the
model is bit-identical to pretrained pi0.5 on step one. The pathway grows from
nothing instead of injecting noise into a 4B model that already works.

UNVERIFIED OFF-INSTANCE. lerobot is not importable in the local environment, so
this is written against the source and not executed. Two things to check first:
  * `observation.tactile` survives `dataset_to_policy_features` and gets
    normalization stats -- it must reach the batch, and it must NOT be swept
    into OBS_STATE (the state tokenizer reads that key by name, so it should
    not be, but confirm rather than assume)
  * the checkpoint round-trips: `tactile_mlp.*` is a new key, so loading a
    stock pi05 checkpoint reports it missing and that is expected
