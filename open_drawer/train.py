"""Fine-tune pi0.5-with-tactile on the recorded demonstrations.

    uv run train
    uv run train --steps=8000 --batch_size=24

A wrapper around `lerobot-train`, not a reimplementation of it. It does three
things the stock entrypoint cannot: register the tactile policy so
`--policy.type=tactile_pi05` resolves, register an 8-bit AdamW so
`--optimizer.type=adamw_8bit` resolves, and fill in the defaults this task needs
so the command is short enough to type correctly. Anything passed on the CLI
wins over a default. Dataloading, checkpointing and resume are all lerobot's.

TWO TRAPS, both load-bearing.

`use_policy_training_preset` defaults to True, and in that mode
`TrainPipelineConfig.validate()` OVERWRITES `cfg.optimizer` with the policy's own
preset. An `--optimizer.type=adamw_8bit` passed alongside it parses fine, is
silently discarded, and training runs in 32-bit AdamW -- no warning, just a lot
of extra memory. So the preset is off here. For pi0.5 that costs nothing else:
`PI05Policy.get_optim_params()` returns `self.parameters()`, exactly what the
non-preset path uses anyway.

CHUNK SIZE IS THE DATA CONTRACT. `chunk_size=16` / `n_action_steps=4` is the
horizon the dataset was recorded for, against pi05_base's own default of 50/50.
At 25 Hz that is 640 ms predicted, 160 ms executed open-loop. It only sets
sequence lengths in the action expert -- no weight is sized by it -- so the
pretrained checkpoint still loads.

Nothing here runs on a dev box: torch, lerobot and bitsandbytes are all
instance-side.

    Adam remembers two running values per parameter, and with

    moments are bf16 too. Quantizing them block-wise to 8 bits halves that,
    which is roughly what decides how much is left for activations.

    Defaults mirror `PI05Config.get_optimizer_preset()`, so switching to 8-bit
    changes the memory footprint and nothing about the hyperparameters.
    bitsandbytes already leaves tensors under `min_8bit_size` (4096 elements)
    in 32-bit, so norms and biases are excluded without being asked -- which
    also covers the freshly-initialized tactile encoder's bias.

            Both are fixed at the serialization boundary only -- the kernels
